Goals/Objectives:
To provide the student with the history and motivations of information system, basic common features, architectures and functionalities of database management systems, and the differences between database systems and file-based systems.
To provide student with data modeling ability, to use UML and entity-relationship model to model the real-world and to conduct conceptual database design for business or enterprise.
To provide the student with knowledge on relational model, and its the query languaages, and to be able to convert a conceptual database into a logical database in relational model.
To provide the student with the ability to create database with commerical DBMS system, to enforce constraints and integrities, to improve performance with indexes and stored procedures, and to access database in various ways.
To provide student with ability to design and code GUI interface with client-server architecture.
To enhance the student's abilities of oral and written representations.

Laboratory:

Students will spend two and half hours each week on the following subjects:
(1) Present to the class their findings about the enterprise, and the parts of enterprise he/she will design information system for. 
(2) Present the conceptual database design to the class, and the others make suggestion, discuss the alternatives for the design.
(3) Express queries in relational algebra and relational calculus.
(4) Convert conceptual database to relational database
(5) Study and practice commercial database management system.
(6) Present logical database design.
(7) Present front-end design and implementation, and discussion on each student design and implementation.
Oral and Written Communication:

Three to four times oral presentations are given by each student. A document with investigation, designs and coding is completed by each student at the end of class.
Social and Ethical Issues:

 
Problem Analysis:

Students investigate analyze an enterprise, model the enterprise in parts of a quarter-long project.
Solution Design:

Conceptual, Logical, physical database design and GUI user-interface design will be conducted in a quarter-long project.
